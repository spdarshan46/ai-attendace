# 🤖 AI Face Attendance System

An **AI-powered Face Recognition Attendance System** built using **Python, OpenCV, Face Recognition, MongoDB, and CustomTkinter**.
The system automatically detects and recognizes employees' faces and records **login and logout attendance** with **voice feedback**.

---

# 🚀 Features

✅ **AI Face Recognition**

* Detects and recognizes employee faces using the `face_recognition` library.

✅ **Automatic Attendance Marking**

* Records **login and logout time** automatically in MongoDB.

✅ **Anti-Spoof Detection**

* Detects fake attempts (photo/video) by checking face movement.

✅ **Voice Assistant**

* Provides **offline voice feedback** using `pyttsx3`.

Example:

* "Welcome Darshan. Attendance marked successfully."
* "Goodbye Darshan. Logout recorded."

✅ **Confidence-Based Recognition**

* Shows recognition confidence percentage.

Example:

DARSHAN (97.4%)

Press ENTER to confirm

✅ **Employee Registration System**

* Capture employee face and generate **128-dimension face encoding**.

✅ **MongoDB Database Storage**
Stores:

* Employee information
* Attendance records
* System logs

✅ **Modern GUI**

* Built with **CustomTkinter**
* Professional UI for Admin and Employee panels.
